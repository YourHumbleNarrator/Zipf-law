# Zipf's Law Analysis

## Project Description

The aim of this project is to investigate Zipf's Law through the analysis of a word corpus and the implementation of a Python program that will enable word counting, language identification, and the determination of Portuguese ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ language rules based on core words.

## Project Components

1. **Corpus Collection**
   - Gathering word data from various Creative Commons license sources such as Wikipedia, Gutenberg Project, ResearchGate and Museu Nacional do Azulejo.
   - Preparing textual datasets for analysis.

2. **Python Program for Word Counting**
   - Implementing a script for frequency analysis.
   - Utilizing appropriate libraries (e.g., `collections`, `re`).

3. **Testing the Validity of Zipf's Law**
   - Analyzing the distribution of word frequencies.
   - Verifying whether the results align with the predictions of Zipf's Law.

4. **Language Identification**
   - Developing an algorithm to find core words (relations between words).
   - Creating a graph of core words (Co-occurrence Network)
   - Deriving language rules based on the observation of results

5. **Top 50 Nouns and Their Translations**
   - Identifying the 50 most frequently occurring nouns in the corpus.

## Installation

## Technology Used
